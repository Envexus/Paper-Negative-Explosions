Subject: [PATCH] Don't apply cramming damage to players

It does not make a lot of sense to damage players if they get crammed,
 especially as the usecase of teleporting lots of players to the same
 location isn't too uncommon and killing all those players isn't
 really what one would expect to happen.

For those who really want it a config option is provided.
